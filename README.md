# Resume_Matching System Using NLP

Objective : Build a system that automatically ranks resumes based on their similarity to a job description using NLP techniques.

Dataset:

Resumes CSV: resumes.csv

Columns:
resume_id
resume_text 
experience → Years of experience (optional, can be used later)

job_description.txt:  Plain text of the job posting

Note: Both files are small and synthetic .


Future Improvements:

Combine experience with similarity score
Use dynamic keyword weighting based on JD
Use semantic embeddings(BERT, Sentence Transformers) for better understanding of text meaning
Build a web interface for recruiters to upload JD and view ranked resumes
